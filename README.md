# BrainWave-DBS
This repository contains MATLAB code to extract, pre-process and synchronize LFP data from the Medtronic Percept, designed for researchers and clinicians working with DBS recordings.


This pipeline was created by Albert Guilemette (albert.guillemette@umontreal.ca) in collaboration with the Functional Neurosurgery lab and the Dancause Lab of the University of Montreal (led by Dr Marie-Pierre Fournier-Gosselin and Prof Numa Dancause, respectively).
