# BrainWave-DBS
This repository contains MATLAB code to extract, pre-process and analyze LFP data from the Medtronic Percept streaming mode, designed for researchers and clinicians working with DBS recordings.


This pipeline was created by Albert Guilemette (albert.guillemette@umontreal.ca) in collaboration with the Functional Neurosurgery lab and the Dancause Lab of the University of Montreal. These labs are led by Dr Marie-Pierre Fournier-Gosselin (marie-pierre.fournier-gosselin@umontreal.ca) and Prof Numa Dancause (numa.dancause@umontreal.ca), respectively.
